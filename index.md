## 🚀 Recent Projects

Here’s a quick look at what I’ve been building lately:

### 🔍 Searchly AI

**Searchly AI** is a semantic search engine tailored for e‑commerce. It lets customers discover products using natural language like "red running shoes under $20" and delivers intent‑aware, context‑relevant results. With a plug‑and‑play WooCommerce plugin, blazing‑fast AI search, real‑time catalog synching, and no code setup, it boosts discovery and conversions from day one.

### 🔌 ElasticBridge

**ElasticBridge** is an open‑source Laravel package that offers a fluent, Eloquent‑style API for interacting with Elasticsearch indexes. It allows you to query, index, filter, and aggregate data using familiar Laravel syntax, making complex search features feel seamless and maintainable.
